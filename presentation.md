# Why VIM

## Pros
* Fast and Lightweight
* More productivity with less typing
* Customizable
* Free
* Portable
* Fun

## Cons
* Steep learning curve
* Default configurations sucks
* Doesn't have a _"modern"_ look and feel

# Vim Philosophy

## Vim is a Modal editor

| ---     | ---:         |
| normal  | <ESC> <C-[>  |
| insert  |  i I a A o O |
| command | :            |
| visual  | v V <C-v>    |


## Vim Grammar
